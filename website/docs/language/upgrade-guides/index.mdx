# Upgrading to Terraform v1.6

-> **Tip:** Use the version selector to view the upgrade guides for older Terraform versions.

Terraform v1.6 is a minor release in the stable Terraform v1.0 series.

Terraform v1.6 honors the
[Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1-compatibility-promises),
but there are some behavior changes outside of those promises that may affect a
small number of users. Specifically, the following updates may require
additional upgrade steps:
* [End of experimental period for `terraform test`](#terraform-test)
* [S3 Backend may need to be reconfigured](#s3-backend)

See [the full changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.6/CHANGELOG.md)
for more details. If you encounter any problems during upgrading which are not
covered this guide, please start a new topic in
[the Terraform community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core)
to discuss it.

## Terraform Test

The previous experimental `terraform test` command has been deprecated and replaced with a fully supported and finalized `terraform test` command.

There are substantial differences between the previous experimental approach and the finalized approach:

- The builtin test provider, `terraform.io/builtin/test`, has been removed and a dedicated syntax introduced for testing files.
- A new `.tftest.hcl` file extension has been introduced for testing files, allowing a change into the directory structure and test file layout.
- Test assertions and conditions execute with extended scope and access to the configuration under test.

The major differences are discussed here, for more information consult the [CLI](/terraform/cli/test) and [Language](/terraform/language/tests) documentation.

### Directory structure

Previously, test files would be placed within their own subdirectories underneath the `tests` directory from the configuration directory. The following example contains three test files using the experimental framework:

```
main.tf
outputs.tf
providers.tf
variables.tf
tests/
  defaults/
    test_defaults.tf
  maximums/
    test_maximums.tf
  minimums/
    test_minimums.tf
```

With the new directory structure, tests are defined using the new `.tftest.hcl` file extension and do not need to be embedded within subdirectories. To help with organization, test files can, optionally, be embedded within a test directory. The name for this test directory defaults to `tests`, but can be overridden with the `-test-directory` flag.

The following examples are both valid directory structures for test files in the updated framework:

```
main.tf
outputs.tf
providers.tf
variables.tf
defaults.tftest.hcl
maximums.tftest.hcl
minimums.tftest.hcl
```

```
main.tf
outputs.tf
providers.tf
variables.tf
tests/
  defaults.tftest.hcl
  maximums.tftest.hcl
  minimums.tftest.hcl
```

### Test structure and assertions

Previously, a test file would contain a module call and a collection of resources from the builtin `test` provider:

```hcl
# tests/defaults/test_defaults.tf

terraform{
  required_providers {
    test = {
      source = "terraform.io/builtin/test"
    }
  }
}

module "main" {
  source = "../.."
}

resource "test_assertions" "api_url" {
  component = "api_url"

  equal "scheme" {
    description = "default scheme is https"
    got         = module.main.scheme
    want        = "https"
  }
  check "port_number" {
    description = "default port number is 8080"
    condition   = can(regex(":8080$", module.main.authority))
  }
}
```

With the new framework each test file is made up of a series of `run` blocks. Each `run` block represents a single `terraform plan` or a `terraform apply` operation executed against the main configuration. Assertions from within these `run` blocks can access outputs, variables, resources, and local values from the main configuration directly.

```hcl
# tests/defaults.tftest.hcl

run "test_defaults" {
  assert {
    condition     = output.scheme == "https"
    error_message = "default scheme should be https"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = can(regex(":8080", output.authority))
    error_message = "default port number should be 8080"
  }
}
```

The above examples demonstrates the differences in layout, scope and access between the two approaches. In the experimental framework, access is granted as if the configuration was being called like a normal module call. In the released framework, assertions execute as if they are custom conditions defined within the main configuration directly.

The `run` block also applies or plans the main configuration by default, there is no need for the specific module call seen in the experimental framework.

## S3 Backend

The S3 Backend has been updated, with a number of added and deprecated fields.
These changes bring the S3 Backend configuration closer to the AWS Provider configuration.

-> **Note:** Because of these changes, you may need to run `terraform init -reconfigure`,
even if there have been no changes to your backend configuration.

### Deprecations

The major deprecations are discussed here.
For more information, consult the [S3 Backend documentation](/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3).

Configuration for assuming an IAM Role has been moved from a number of top-level attributes into the attribute `assume_role`.
Previously, the configuration to assume the IAM role `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/example` with a session name `example-session` and a session duration of 15 minutes was:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    # additional configuration omitted for brevity
    role_arn                     = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/example"
    session_name                 = "example-session"
    assume_role_duration_seconds = 900
  }
}
```

The updated configuration is:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    # additional configuration omitted for brevity
    assume_role = {
      role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/example"
      session_name = "example-session"
      duration     = "15m"
    }
  }
}
```

The AWS API endpoint override attributes
`endpoint` (for S3),
`dynamodb_endpoint`,
`iam_endpoint`, and
`sts_endpoint`
have been replaced with the attributes `endpoints` and the corresponding nested attributes
`s3`,
`dynamodb`,
`iam`, and
`sts`.
