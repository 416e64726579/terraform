# filesha1 function reference
This topic provides reference information about the `filesha1` function, which calculates the SHA-1 hash of a file's contents. 

## Introduction

The `filesha1` is a variant of [`sha1`](/terraform/language/functions/sha1) that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string. 

This is similar to `sha1(file(filename))`, but
because [`file`](/terraform/language/functions/file) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.

!> **Security warning**: Collision attacks have been successfully performed against this hashing function. Before using this function for anything security-sensitive, review relevant literature to understand the security implications.

## Syntax

Use the filesha1 function with the following syntax:

```hcl
filesha1(path) 
```

The `path` is the file path (relative or absolute) to the file whose SHA-1 hash you want to compute.

In the following example, the function returns the SHA-1 value.

```hcl
> filesha1("example.txt")
d3486ae9136e7856bc42212385ea797094475802
```

## Example use case

In the following example the `filesha1` function computes the SHA-1 hash of the file `example.txt` located in the current module's directory. The result will be a 40-character hexadecimal string representing the SHA-1 hash.

```hcl
output "file_hash" { value = filesha1("${path.module}/example.txt") }
```
