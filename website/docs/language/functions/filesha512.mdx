# `filesha512` function reference
This topic provides reference information about the `filesha512` function, which calculates the SHA-1 hash of a file's contents. 

## Introduction

`filesha512` is a variant of [`sha512`](/terraform/language/functions/sha512)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to `sha512(file(filename))`, but
because [`file`](/terraform/language/functions/file) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.

## Syntax

Use the `abs` function with the following syntax:

```hcl
abs(number) 
```

The `number` argument is the number you want the absolute value of.

In the following example, the function returns the absolute value of 23, 0, and -12.4.

```hcl
> abs(23)
23
> abs(0)
0
> abs(-12.4)
12.4
```

## Example use case

The following example defines a variable `num` that is negative. The function outputs the absolute value of num, which is 10.

```hcl
variable "num" {
  default = -10
}

output "absolute_value" {
  value = abs(var.num)
}
```
